# User Information Application

### Version 2
- Added ajax search for autocomplete results list.
- Added result list behaviour that reponds to hover, clicks and arrow input
- Added light server load behaviour for the results list. The request is only triggered when the initial character is typed in since from that point on the retrieved list will only get shorter. Only if the first character is replaced another request will fire.

### Version 1
- Application that takes a JSON file with users and displays it's output.
- There's a search form which takes multiple arguments and converts to proper capitalisation.
- The add page allows you to add a new user and directs you back to the main user page.
